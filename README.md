# RedMagic 11 Pro (NX809J) - Kernel Compilation and Boot Guide

> [!NOTE]
> Para a versão em português deste guia, consulte o arquivo [README_PT.md](README_PT.md).

This guide explains how to compile, pack, and boot the custom kernel with **KernelSU-Next** and **Binary Parity** support via RAM (without permanently flashing the phone's partitions), and outlines the next steps for project development.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

To ensure compilation and packaging work correctly, you must supply the following components (which are configured in `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean):

1. **Clang Toolchain (r536225)**:
   - Download the AOSP Clang toolchain (revision `r536225`).
   - Extract it to the root of this repository in a folder named `clang-r536225/` (such that the main binary is located at `clang-r536225/bin/clang`).
   - Alternatively, you can set the `CLANG_DIR` environment variable pointing to your Clang directory before compiling.

2. **Device Tree Blob (`dtb.img`)**:
   - Extract the official `dtb.img` file from the stock ZTE boot image (`boot.img`) corresponding to your target userdebug ROM.
   - Place the `dtb.img` file directly in the root of this repository. It is required to concatenate the Device Trees to the kernel image during packaging.

3. **Host Dependencies**:
   - Ensure your Linux machine has the essential build packages installed (`build-essential`, `libssl-dev`, `bison`, `flex`, `libelf-dev`, `python3`, etc.).

## 🚀 1. How to Compile and Boot the Kernel

### Step A: Compile the Main Kernel and Techpacks
We use the unified script [super_build.sh](super_build.sh) which sets up the environment, applies the platform defconfig (`nx809j_defconfig`), injects security flags (CFI Permissive, KernelSU-Next), and compiles the binaries with the appropriate Clang toolchain.

Run in your terminal:
```bash
./super_build.sh
```
* The kernel will be compiled and the resulting image will be located at: `kernel_platform/common/arch/arm64/boot/Image`.

---

### Step B: Pack and Sign the Boot Image (DTB + AVB)
Qualcomm's dynamic drivers require the physical concatenation of Device Trees (`dtb.img`) into the kernel header. The script [repack_perfect_sign.sh](repack_perfect_sign.sh) handles packaging without an internal ramdisk (exact size of 64MB) and performs the mandatory cryptographic signing via AVB to avoid bootloader lockouts.

Run:
```bash
./repack_perfect_sign.sh
```
* This will generate the signed boot image in the root of the project: **`dev_reverse_perfect.img`**.

---

### Step C: Boot in RAM (Temporary Boot)
> [!WARNING]
> **NEVER run `fastboot flash boot` or flash this image permanently to your device during the testing phase.** The boot must always be loaded temporarily in RAM. If the system hangs or presents issues, simply holding the Power button for 10 seconds will restore the original official boot.

1. Reboot your smartphone into bootloader mode:
   ```bash
   adb reboot bootloader
   ```
2. Boot the image directly into RAM using fastboot:
   ```bash
   sudo fastboot boot dev_reverse_perfect.img
   ```
   *(Enter your sudo password if the terminal prompts for root privileges to establish USB communication with fastboot).*

3. The phone will boot into Android. Once booted, you can validate the active kernel by running:
   ```bash
   adb shell uname -a
   ```
   You should see the signature indicating your custom build with active **KernelSU-Next** support.

## 🛠️ 2. Project Next Steps

Now that we have achieved stable binary parity compatibility (where the custom kernel loads and runs the system normally), we can begin the specific development tasks described in [NEXT_STEPS.md](NEXT_STEPS.md):

### 1. Deploy and Test Rebuilt Modules (.ko)
Since booting via RAM uses the physical partitions and mounts `/vendor_dlkm` from the original system, the active modules at the moment are ZTE's original ones. To execute our rebuilt modules (reconstructed from Ghidra source code):
* **Built-in Method:** Modify the `Kbuild` of the drivers we rebuilt (such as `zte_charger_policy` and `zte_led`), changing the compilation to built-in (`obj-y` instead of `obj-m`). This way, they will be compiled directly inside the `Image` file and loaded before the system initializes the official ones.

### 2. GPU Overclock to 1200MHz+
* Extract and decompile the original Device Tree (`dtb.img` or `dtbo.img`) into text format (`.dts`).
* Locate the OPP (Operating Performance Points) table for the Adreno 830 GPU.
* Add the overclock frequency steps (with correct voltage bindings) to achieve a stable 1200MHz+.
* Recompile the tree and test via `fastboot boot`.

### 3. Full Integration of Other Techpacks
* Adapt and compile the touch modules (`touch-drivers`) to validate physical screen interaction using our tree.
* Validate mobile network connectivity (`dataipa`).

### 4. Audit of Proprietary Locks and CFI
* Monitor panic logs (`dmesg` and `console-ramoops-0`) to map any remaining CFI (Control Flow Integrity) failures in the loaded modules.
